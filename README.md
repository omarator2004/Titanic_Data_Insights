# 🛳️ Titanic Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  

This project is part of my learning path in Data Science.  
In this notebook, I focused on **data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering** using the Titanic dataset.  

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset  
- Handled missing values (Cabin, Age, Embarked)  
- Created new features:  
  - **Deck** (from Cabin)  
  - **Title** (from Name)  
  - **IsAlone** (family size feature)  
  - **AgeBin** (categorical bins from Age)  
- Encoded categorical variables (Label/OneHot)  
- Scaled numerical features  
- Final dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for machine learning models  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📊 Next Steps
This project ends at dataset preprocessing (Week 2).  
In Week 3, I will build and evaluate machine learning models for survival prediction.
